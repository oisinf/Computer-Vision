Assignment1-Working Camera Calibration script to compute perspective projection matrix of a camera P given a set of correspondences between 3D and 2D points. This script also visualises the reprojection of the 3D calibration points computed using the computed camera matrix P. 2D points displayed in green, computed reprojection of 3D points shown in red. 

Assignment2-
Part1-Working Camera Calibration script that given a real image from a webcam computes the distortion and instrinsic parameters of the camera and outputs an undistorted version of the image. 

Part2-Working Planar Augmented Reality script that generates a set of correspondences between a checkboard and undistorted image. These correspondences are used to compute the homography that maps points on the checkboard to the image. Finally an image is projected that lies in the plane of the checkboard.
